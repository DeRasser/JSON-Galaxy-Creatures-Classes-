"galaxy.json" file contains information about all Galaxies that exist. Each Galaxy has Creatures that belong to any Species. Each creature has its name, id, age and status(healthy/weak)

#What does the program do?
- So the program gives you an opportunity to find all creatures by their status. You should just input which status you want to search creatures by. That's all.

Continues...(There will be added an opportunity to add your own creature, species and EVEN GALAXY)
